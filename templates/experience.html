    <h2>AI and Machine Learning Internship</h2>
    <p>
       I am awarded to <strong>Shanshad Alam</strong> in recognition of my hard work and dedication during the 
      <strong>AI and Machine Learning Internship</strong><br>
      <strong>Teamwork & Professionalism :</strong> <br>
During my three-month internship as an AI & Machine Learning Intern, I collaborated closely with a cross-functional team of developers and data scientists. I communicated progress and challenges clearly in team meetings and daily stand-ups, documented my work, and contributed ideas during brainstorming sessions. I consistently followed established workflows, met deadlines, and maintained discipline in my tasks. This experience strengthened my ability to work effectively in a team, adapt to processes, and deliver quality results in a professional environment. <br>
